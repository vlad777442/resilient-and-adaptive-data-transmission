# Simulations Overview

This directory contains simulation code for our research project. Here, you'll find general-purpose simulation tools and frameworks that are used across multiple experiments.
This directory contains simulation code for **Janus: Resilient and Adaptive Data Transmission for Enabling Timely and Efficient Cross-Facility Scientific Workflows** project. 

## Structure

- `/simulation_static_sc1/` - Simulation with constant parameters m
- `/simulation_adaptive_sc1/` - Simulation with adaptive parameters m
- `/simulation_adaptive_sc2/` - Simulation with adaptive parameters m for second scenario
